JSquared is a Rust CLI tool allowing for a
quick and optimized way of creating a
DuckDB instance from Parquet files.

This project is my first experience with
database management through Rust as well
as my first encounter with the Parquet
ecosystem. I've found from research that
Parquet is considered the gold standard
for data engineering columnar data
formatting, and want to be adequeately
equipped to handle the formatting.
